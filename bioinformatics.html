    <h2>Institute of Functinal Genomics of Lyon : January 2025 to July 2026</h2>
    <h3> (1) Single Cell Resolution Exploratory and Comparative Analysis applied to support the research work of two research groups :</h3>

    <div class="project-details">
        <p class="spacing-md"></p>
        <p><strong>1. Evolution of the Cervical Region (10X Genomics):</strong> Exploratory analysis of molecular signatures underlying cellular 
            differentiation in the neck and trunk. This study aims to understand cervical development from the trunk by integrating 
            multi-species data to identify morphogens that drive species-specific neck patterning and the evolutionary innovation of 
            the cervical region. Findings from this work may inform future therapies for congenital neck malformations.</p>

        <p class="spacing-md"></p>
        <p><strong>2. Gut Microbiota and Stunted Growth (Parse Biosience):</strong> Investigating host–microbe interactions in the small intestine using 
            single-cell genomics. Chronic undernutrition affects over 155 million children worldwide, leading to stunted growth and long-term 
            developmental impairments. Even after nutritional rehabilitation, the gut microbiota of affected children often remains immature. 
            This project aims to: decode how commensal bacteria modulate host responses to malnutrition; understand how host nutritional status 
            shapes microbial ecology; and develop targeted microbial interventions to counteract growth retardation. The experimental approach 
            combines gnotobiology, genetics, and functional genomics, utilizing model organisms colonized with defined bacterial communities, 
            followed by sequencing and bioinformatic analysis.</p>

        <p><strong>Brief introduction to single-cell resolution exploratory analysis</strong></p>

        <p>There are many sequencing technologies available for single-cell studies, with 10X Genomics and Parse Biosciences being among the 
            most prominent platforms. Library preparation methods vary depending on the technology used, but they all fundamentally rely on 
            cell isolation, barcoding, and sequencing. Depending on the depth and scope of the study, samples can be multiplexed, which must 
            be carefully considered during preprocessing and analysis to ensure accurate quantitative read distribution and attribution. 
            I have designed a workflow summarized in Figure 1 that captures the key components and analytical environments surrounding 
            single-cell resolution studies.</p>

        <p class="spacing-md"></p>

        </div>
        <p><strong>Fig 1.</strong> Exploratory analysis at single cell resolution level.</p>

        <p class="spacing-md"></p>
        <p><strong>scRNA-Seq :</strong></p>
        <p>Single-cell RNA sequencing begins with tissue dissociation or environmental sample processing to obtain a single-cell suspension. 
            Cells are isolated using methods such as FACS, laser capture microdissection, or microfluidic platforms. Following RNA extraction 
            and library preparation, high-throughput sequencing generates transcriptomic profiles for individual cells.</p>

        <p class="spacing-md"></p>
        <p>The preprocessed data undergoes quality control and normalization, followed by dimensionality reduction techniques (UMAP, t-SNE) to 
            visualize cellular heterogeneity. Gene regulatory network (GRN) reconstruction identifies regulons—sets of co-regulated genes 
            controlled by shared transcription factors. Trajectory analysis and lineage tracing reveal developmental paths and cell state 
            transitions. Clustering algorithms group cells into distinct populations based on gene expression signatures, enabling the 
            identification of cell types, rare populations, and transitional states.</p>

        <p class="spacing-md"></p>
        <p><strong>scATAC-Seq :</strong></p>
        <p>Single-cell ATAC sequencing maps chromatin accessibility landscapes at single-cell resolution. After cell isolation and nuclei extraction, 
            the ATAC-seq protocol identifies open chromatin regions genome-wide through transposase-mediated fragmentation.</p>

        <p class="spacing-md"></p>
        <p>Computational analysis identifies accessible peaks and performs regulatory motif enrichment analysis to determine which 
            transcription factors are likely active in each cell. Integration with gene expression data reveals correlations between 
            chromatin accessibility and transcriptional activity. Marker accessibility analysis identifies cell-type-specific regulatory 
            elements, while chromatin potential modeling predicts regulatory states that govern cell identity and differentiation trajectories.</p>

        <p class="spacing-md"></p>
        <p><strong>Spatial Transcriptomics :</strong></p>
        <p>Spatial Transcriptomics can broadly be defined under two mainstreams : Sequenced-based methods and Imaged-based / Deconvolution methods. 
            
            <div class="sub_project-details">
                <p><strong>Sequenced-based methods</strong> captures mRNA directly from tissue sections with spatial barcoding. methods likely
                Visium, Slide_seq, Sterio-seq, PIXEL-seq provides clean workflow for library preparations. Transcriptome-wide coverage is 
                unbiased but also accounts for lower spatial resolution.</p>

                <p class="spacing-md"></p>
                <p><strong>Imaging-based methods</strong> are great for in situ hybridiation approaches with methods like MERFISH, Merscope, Xenium, osmFISH, 
                seqFISH as well as in situ sequencing with methods like FISSEQ, STARmap. other methods include antibody-based detection.
                Overal, Spatial transcriptomics should account for spatial gradients, spatial heterogeneity, cellular communication, tissue architecture, 
                and function. Be careful of bias due to unaccounted tissue thickness.</p>
            </div>

            <p>Spatial transcriptomics captures gene expression profiles while preserving the native tissue architecture. Following tissue sectioning 
            and spatial barcoding, sequencing generates spatially-resolved transcriptomic data.</p>

        <p class="spacing-md"></p>
        <p>Label transfer from scRNA-seq reference datasets annotates spatial spots with cell type identities and states previously defined 
            through single-cell analysis. This integration enables spatiotemporal gene expression analysis, revealing how gene expression 
            varies across tissue regions and potentially over developmental or disease progression timelines. Spatial distribution mapping 
            visualizes cell type localization, cellular neighborhoods, and tissue organization patterns, providing insights into cell-cell 
            interactions and microenvironmental influences on cellular behavior.</p>
        
        <p class="spacing-md"></p>
        <p><strong>Custom Modelling</strong> </p>
        
        <p class="spacing-md"></p>
        <p>I love to always reserve space for custom modelling because I beleive it is essential for every research work.
        Today, there exist many high throughput technologies to respond to the challenges in the biological world. Considering a more common framwork where 
        different scientist work on the same subject, it is more prominent for them to always have different perspectives, but the possible approaches to resolve 
        this problem may generally be limited to the current technologies or the devolloper's approach and hence there's a high probability of acheiving the same 
        results even with different perspectives. To break out of this loop, there's the need to utilize current approaches as stepping stones to model specific 
        biological phenomens to model niches and responding accordingly to the research perpestives.</p>

        <p class="spacing-md"></p>
        <p>Following this strategy, I have applied two custom approaches in the host-microbe research project. One involved extracting the markers of cell population 
            of interest and predicting their membrane localization (Here I used established methods for validation, modelled DNA structure to predict patterns specific only
            to membrane position via neural network). The other custom pipeline I involved the the prediction of proliferation speed. We obseved that some 
            progenitor populations were slowing down in the small intestines for some conditions.  
            We dug deeper in the properties of molecules governing cell-cycle life span, applied statistics and neural network extract the cell-cycle proliferation speed
            and validated with expected results from literature. In the research team of evo-devo, I developed a custom pipeline
            which involve the use of machine learnng to capture the biological network environment of protein-protein interactions (embeddign space). The next step is to combine this weights with 
            differential gene expression to find the proportions of expression in each conditions driving morhphological interations.</p>

        <p class="spacing-md"></p>
        <p>Other than creating custom pipelines for modelling biologigal systems, I have equally developed many custom pipelines related to comprehensive visualizations</p>

        <p class="spacing-md"></p>
    </div>

    <div class="project-intro">
        <p><strong>In our study</strong>, we adapted these analytical pipelines into a differential exploratory framework. This approach allowed us to systematically 
            probe each experimental condition to identify the core cellular niches driving their distinct biology.  </p>
        <p>In an evolutionary-developmental (Evo-Devo) context, the analysis pinpointed a specific niche at the neck-trunk interface. 
            This supports the hypothesis of a cervico-thoracic transition zone and illuminates the specific progenitor populations involved in 
            limb bud formation from both anatomical regions.</p>
        <p>In the study of stunting, the analysis revealed which specific cell populations are dysregulated by malnutrition and delineated the 
            trajectory of their functional impairment over developmental time.</p>

        <h3>Chromatin accessibility profiling by ATAC-seq :</h3>
        <p>The assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) provides a simple and scalable way to detect the unique 
            chromatin landscape associated with a cell type and how it may be altered by perturbation or disease. It appears more and more in epigenetics 
            studies. ATAC-Seq captures the accessibility of genomic areas in the chromosome which provides some robustness in defining the environment
            surrounding transcription start side.</p>
        
        <br class="spacing-md">
        <div class="centered-image">
            <img src="images_bioinfo/atac-seq.png" alt="Database Method" class="elegant-image"></div>
        
        <br class="spacing-md">
        <p><strong>Fig 2.</strong> Brief description of ATAC=Seq. Modified and printed from Grandi F et al., 2022</p>
    
        <br class="spacing-md">
        <p>Chromatin structure is maintainded along side associated DNA binding proteins from nuclei isolation. It is exposed to the Tn5 transposase, 
            simultaneously fragment the chromatin and insert primer sequences enabling amplification of these fragmented reads preparing them for sequencing.
            After sequencing, bioinformatic pipelines are applied to define the genomic regions accessible by the Tn5. The generally contain shorter reads and 
            are counted as peaks. Longer reads are classified down the road as mononucleosome, dinucleosome based on the fragment lengths. The example pesented in 
            cell type x and cell type y contains peaks in the promoter region. We also observe that cell type x has higher levels of expression of gene A, knowing 
            the role of enhancers, we can hypothesise that the peaks equally observed at enhancer region just above the promoter drives these higer expression of 
            gene A in cell type x. (Grandi F et al., 2022).</p>

        <br class="spacing-md">
        <p>Thus, combining chromatin accessibility (ATAC-seq peaks) and gene expression data allow to infer functional regulatory logic. The coordinated 
            openness of the promoter and its putative enhancer in cell type X suggests an active cis-regulatory module driving higher expression of Gene A</p>

        <br class="spacing-md">

        <h3>chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) :</h3>
        <p>In gene regulation studies, ChIP-Seq and ATAC-Seq have some similarities in thier pipeline approaches but their goals are different and using them rely much more on 
            your research interest. ChIP-seq is a center method used for characterizing genome-wide DNA-binding profile for a protein of interest. It provides a highly specific, 
            protein-centric view of the regulatory landscape, pinpointing where a particular factor—such as a histone modification or transcription factor—interacts with the genome.
            The quality of the data generated and also the analytical results is inherently dependent on the availability and quality of specific antibodies for the target protein.</p>

        <div class="centered-image">

        <br class="spacing-md">

        <p>As always, the first step is the library preparation stage begins by preparing samples which are then chemically fixed to preserve their 
            protein-DNA interactions. Next, the fixed chromatin is physically broken into smaller pieces (sheared). The target protein, along with 
            the DNA bound to it, is then selectively captured using a specific antibody attached to magnetic beads (immunoprecipitation). The isolated 
            complexes are washed, eluted, and the DNA is purified. This DNA is then prepared for sequencing through steps such as amplification 
            and adapter ligation, and is ultimately sequenced.</p>
        
        <br class="spacing-md">

        <p>Once sequenced, the raw data undergoes a multi-step computational analysis. First, the sequenced fragments are mapped back to the genome. 
            The data is then normalized for comparison, and the patterns of where the protein binds are visualized across the genome. Key binding 
            regions, or "peaks," are identified. These peaks are analyzed to discover common DNA sequence patterns (motifs) and are annotated to 
            understand the associated chromatin states, such as promoters or enhancers. Finally, groups of genes near these binding sites are 
            analyzed to determine their biological roles, often revealing involvement in fundamental processes like cell proliferation, growth 
            regulation, and cell adhesion</p>

        <br class="spacing-md">
        <p>ChIP-Seq has become a prominent method to analyse genomic interaction of DNA-protein interactions. Researchers can pinpoint precise 
            genomic binding sites, decipher the DNA codes recognized by proteins, and ultimately link these molecular events to critical biological 
            functions and regulatory networks within the cell. There are interesting ChIP-Seq data databases that can be explored and integrated 
            to provide more meaning to your research.</p>

        <h3>Spatial Transcriptomics :</h3>
        <p>Spatial Transcriptomics today are most useful in the separation of meaningful patterns from complex biological system. Traditional RNA 
            sequencing list the bricks, single-cell sequencing classifies the bricks and spatial transcriptiomics assembles them. It defines a spatiotemporal
            settings of molecular signatures within a biological system and enhance the elucidation of their functions. Fig 5 defines the canonical pipelines 
            and the models behind these pipelines.</p>

        <br class="spacing-md">
        <p>Firstly, it is important to know that there exist many databases for spatial transcriptomics which serve as essential resources for interpreting 
            and contextualizing ST data. These databases, such as SOAR, SpatialDB, and SPASCER, provide curated collections of ST datasets across multiple tissues, 
            developmental stages, and disease states, alongside integrated single-cell RNA-seq reference data that enable cell type deconvolution 
            (label transfer also comes from single-cell datasets generated from personal experiments). </p>
        
        <br class="spacing-md">
        <p>Additionally, these databases supply ligand-receptor interaction pairs critical for analyzing cell-cell communication, benchmark datasets for validating 
            spatial domain identification and spatially variable genes, and pre-computed spatial patterns that help distinguish normal tissue architecture from 
            disease-specific alterations. Without these databases, spatial transcriptomics data would remain difficult to interpret, lacking the biological context 
            needed to transform raw spatial gene expression into meaningful insights about tissue organization, cellular interactions, and disease mechanisms.</p>

        <br class="space-md">
        <p><strong>Library preparation methods</strong> for spatial transcriptiomics depends on research interest as always, but the most prominent technologies
            are in situ hybridization (ISH) an imaged based, in situ sequencing (ISS), and in situ capturing (ISC) a sequenced based technologies. ISH and ISS to 
            focus on the capturing of specific 
            genes while ISC captures captures transcripts in an unbiased manner for transcriptiome-wide study. Targeted approaches can be sensitive to transcript 
            present in the given tissue, but fewer unique genes can be assayed at once but with low effiency (only fractions of RNAs are captured). The resolution 
            of these technologies refers to how exact of a location is retained for any particular transcript and can range from subcellular localization to a 
            55 μm-diameter capture spot with distinct x‒y spatial coordinates. One prominent challenge is all ST technologies currently suffer from the suboptimal 
            depth and/or coverage of the transcripts assayed from intact tissue compared with scRNA-seq (Fig 6 left).</p>

        <br class="space-md">
        <p>With ISH, we have signals from probes targeting short sequences of transcripts are propagated by consecutive rounds of hybridization, imaging, and probe 
            stripping (seqFISH methods for example). ISS methods typically involve the hybridization and ligation of a barcoded padlock probe complementary to the RNA 
            or cDNA of a target gene. Multiple rounds of target amplification and sequencing by ligation then allow for spatial resolution of the distinct target gene. 
             ISC methods (captures in situ and sequenced ex situ) use capture spots containing an array of RT primers with distinct positional barcodes and poly-T 
             sequences to capture mRNA transcripts. 
             RT produces cDNAs that are extracted and sequenced using next-generation sequencing.</p>

        <br class="space-md">
        <p><strong>The connonical analysis pipeline</strong> is as similar to other sparced datasets analysis pipelines. The steps within preprocessing include but are 
            not limited to quality control (QC), normalization, and dimensionality reduction. QC metrics such as the number of molecules per capture spot (counts per spot) 
            and genes per spot indicate the depth of the data. Normalization accounts for differences in sequencing and capture depth across spots and is further 
            complicated by variations in cellular density across the tissue. Preprocessing comes after raw data processing where  raw sequencing data are processed into 
            count matrices consisting of genes and capture spots. Next, Clustering groups similar spot transcriptomes, which can be transposed over the original tissue 
            images for general interpretation after which, mapping and deconvolution combine scRNA-seq data with spatial transcriptomics data to localize cell subpopulations
            (label transfer). At this stage, ligand‒receptor analyses can be applied to the celltype maps generated from mapping and deconvolution. The proximity of cell 
            types can help infer cell‒cell communication events (Fig 6 right). It is important to note that downstream analysis for ST data seeks to identify spatial domains with coherent 
            gene expression, such as tissue niches and cell‒cell interactions which may accounts for neighboring spot information, tissue histology, and cellular morphology.</p>

    <h3> (2) Highlights on the third research group working on Molecular and Epigenetic regulation of Biological Clocks</h3>
    
    <br class="spacing-md">
    <p>I choosed to define ChIP-Seq and ATAC-Seq above because they were used together with single-cell rna-seq to study the regulatory framwork 
        underlying the research questions of out studies but they where equally used independently to rapidly establish the chromatin structure of 
        two subprojects in this team. My main work in this team was applying stastiscal pipelines to decode the mechanisms driving the proteome of 
        biological physiology most especially effects of biological rythmicity in physiology</p>

    <p>The physiology of mamals follows a circiadian biological rythm, diurnal for humans and nocturnal for mice. The circadian project aims to study
        physiology accross both time frames to capture rythmicity niches and decode how they drive gene expressions and important mamal processes like metabolism in the liver.
        I applied statistical methods to correct for technical and biological noise as well as bias due to limit of detection to infer these functionalities from mass spectrometry
        data. input data were optain from ms/ms output. While mass spectrometry data remain inherently biased as a result of reasons ranging from sample handling to differences 
        caused by the instrumentation, it has equally
        gained grounds in the field of proteomics to to capture and study proteins and enzymes (molecular workers) in a given sample in our case the liver. Firstly, let's briefly introduce
        mass spectrometry technologies.</p>

    <br class="space-md">
    <p>Mass spectrometry techniques have emerged as high-throughput bioanalytical methods within the field of proteomics. For quantitative analysis of proteomic differences, 
        several MS-based quantification strategies have been developed over the years. With the most prominent being label-free and label-based approaches. The former type 
        implies spectral counting and ion intensity-based quantification and the latter type metabolic, enzymatic or chemical labeling strategies. </p>
