    <div class="project-details">
        <p class="spacing-md"></p>
        <p><strong>1. Evolution of the Cervical Region (10X Genomics):</strong> Exploratory analysis of molecular signatures underlying cellular 
            differentiation in the neck and trunk. This study aims to understand cervical development from the trunk by integrating 
            multi-species data to identify morphogens that drive species-specific neck patterning and the evolutionary innovation of 
            the cervical region. Findings from this work may inform future therapies for congenital neck malformations.</p>

        <p class="spacing-md"></p>
        <p><strong>2. Gut Microbiota and Stunted Growth (Parse Biosience):</strong> Investigating host–microbe interactions in the small intestine using 
            single-cell genomics. Chronic undernutrition affects over 155 million children worldwide, leading to stunted growth and long-term 
            developmental impairments. Even after nutritional rehabilitation, the gut microbiota of affected children often remains immature. 
            This project aims to: decode how commensal bacteria modulate host responses to malnutrition; understand how host nutritional status 
            shapes microbial ecology; and develop targeted microbial interventions to counteract growth retardation. The experimental approach 
            combines gnotobiology, genetics, and functional genomics, utilizing model organisms colonized with defined bacterial communities, 
            followed by sequencing and bioinformatic analysis.</p>

        <p><strong>Brief introduction to single-cell resolution exploratory analysis</strong></p>

        <p>There are many sequencing technologies available for single-cell studies, with 10X Genomics and Parse Biosciences being among the 
            most prominent platforms. Library preparation methods vary depending on the technology used, but they all fundamentally rely on 
            cell isolation, barcoding, and sequencing. Depending on the depth and scope of the study, samples can be multiplexed, which must 
            be carefully considered during preprocessing and analysis to ensure accurate quantitative read distribution and attribution. 
            I have designed a workflow summarized in Figure 1 that captures the key components and analytical environments surrounding 
            single-cell resolution studies.</p>

        <p><strong>Fig 1.</strong> Exploratory analysis at single cell resolution level.</p>

        <p class="spacing-md"></p>
        <p><strong>scRNA-Seq :</strong></p>
        <p>Single-cell RNA sequencing begins with tissue dissociation or environmental sample processing to obtain a single-cell suspension. 
            Cells are isolated using methods such as FACS, laser capture microdissection, or microfluidic platforms. Following RNA extraction 
            and library preparation, high-throughput sequencing generates transcriptomic profiles for individual cells.</p>

        <p class="spacing-md"></p>
        <p>The preprocessed data undergoes quality control and normalization, followed by dimensionality reduction techniques (UMAP, t-SNE) to 
            visualize cellular heterogeneity. Gene regulatory network (GRN) reconstruction identifies regulons—sets of co-regulated genes 
            controlled by shared transcription factors. Trajectory analysis and lineage tracing reveal developmental paths and cell state 
            transitions. Clustering algorithms group cells into distinct populations based on gene expression signatures, enabling the 
            identification of cell types, rare populations, and transitional states.</p>

        <p class="spacing-md"></p>
        <p><strong>scATAC-Seq :</strong></p>
        <p>Single-cell ATAC sequencing maps chromatin accessibility landscapes at single-cell resolution. After cell isolation and nuclei extraction, 
            the ATAC-seq protocol identifies open chromatin regions genome-wide through transposase-mediated fragmentation.</p>

        <p class="spacing-md"></p>
        <p>Computational analysis identifies accessible peaks and performs regulatory motif enrichment analysis to determine which 
            transcription factors are likely active in each cell. Integration with gene expression data reveals correlations between 
            chromatin accessibility and transcriptional activity. Marker accessibility analysis identifies cell-type-specific regulatory 
            elements, while chromatin potential modeling predicts regulatory states that govern cell identity and differentiation trajectories.</p>

        <p class="spacing-md"></p>
        <p><strong>Spatial Transcriptomics :</strong></p>
        <p>Spatial Transcriptomics can broadly be defined under two mainstreams : Sequenced-based methods and Imaged-based / Deconvolution methods. 
            
            <div class="sub_project-details">
                <p><strong>Sequenced-based methods</strong> captures mRNA directly from tissue sections with spatial barcoding. methods likely
                Visium, Slide_seq, Sterio-seq, PIXEL-seq provides clean workflow for library preparations. Transcriptome-wide coverage is 
                unbiased but also accounts for lower spatial resolution.</p>

                <p class="spacing-md"></p>
                <p><strong>Imaging-based methods</strong> are great for in situ hybridiation approaches with methods like MERFISH, Merscope, Xenium, osmFISH, 
                seqFISH as well as in situ sequencing with methods like FISSEQ, STARmap. other methods include antibody-based detection.
                Overal, Spatial transcriptomics should account for spatial gradients, spatial heterogeneity, cellular communication, tissue architecture, 
                and function. Be careful of bias due to unaccounted tissue thickness.</p>
            </div>

            <p>Spatial transcriptomics captures gene expression profiles while preserving the native tissue architecture. Following tissue sectioning 
            and spatial barcoding, sequencing generates spatially-resolved transcriptomic data.</p>

        <p class="spacing-md"></p>
        <p>Label transfer from scRNA-seq reference datasets annotates spatial spots with cell type identities and states previously defined 
            through single-cell analysis. This integration enables spatiotemporal gene expression analysis, revealing how gene expression 
            varies across tissue regions and potentially over developmental or disease progression timelines. Spatial distribution mapping 
            visualizes cell type localization, cellular neighborhoods, and tissue organization patterns, providing insights into cell-cell 
            interactions and microenvironmental influences on cellular behavior.</p>
        
        <p class="spacing-md"></p>
    </div>

    <div class="project-intro">
        <p><strong>In our study</strong>, we adapted these analytical pipelines into a differential exploratory framework. This approach allowed us to systematically 
            probe each experimental condition to identify the core cellular niches driving their distinct biology.  </p>
        <p>In an evolutionary-developmental (Evo-Devo) context, the analysis pinpointed a specific niche at the neck-trunk interface. 
            This supports the hypothesis of a cervico-thoracic transition zone and illuminates the specific progenitor populations involved in 
            limb bud formation from both anatomical regions.</p>
        <p>In the study of stunting, the analysis revealed which specific cell populations are dysregulated by malnutrition and delineated the 
            trajectory of their functional impairment over developmental time.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Chromatin accessibility profiling by ATAC-seq :</h3>
    <p>The assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) provides a simple and scalable way to detect the unique 
        chromatin landscape associated with a cell type and how it may be altered by perturbation or disease. It appears more and more in epigenetics 
        studies. ATAC-Seq captures the accessibility of genomic areas in the chromosome which provides some robustness in defining the environment
        surrounding transcription start side.</p>
    
    <p class="spacing-md"></p>
    <div class="centered-image">
        <img src="images_bioinfo/atac-seq.png" alt="Database Method" class="elegant-image"></div>
    <p><strong>Fig 2.</strong> Brief description of ATAC=Seq. Modified and printed from Grandi F et al., 2022</p>
   
    <p class="spacing-md"></p>
    <p>Chromatin structure is maintainded along side associated DNA binding proteins from nuclei isolation. It is exposed to the Tn5 transposase, 
        simultaneously fragment the chromatin and insert primer sequences enabling amplification of these fragmented reads preparing them for sequencing.
        After sequencing, bioinformatic pipelines are applied to define the genomic regions accessible by the Tn5. The generally contain shorter reads and 
        are counted as peaks. Longer reads are classified down the road as mononucleosome, dinucleosome based on the fragment lengths. The example pesented in 
        cell type x and cell type y contains peaks in the promoter region. We also observe that cell type x has higher levels of expression of gene A, knowing 
        the role of enhancers, we can hypothesise that the peaks equally observed at enhancer region just above the promoter drives these higer expression of 
        gene A in cell type x. (Grandi F et al., 2022).</p>

    <p class="spacing-md"></p>
    <p>Thus, combining chromatin accessibility (ATAC-seq peaks) and gene expression data allow to infer functional regulatory logic. The coordinated 
        openness of the promoter and its putative enhancer in cell type X suggests an active cis-regulatory module driving higher expression of Gene A</p>

    <p class="spacing-md"></p>
    <p>At the time of these studies (also see below), <strong>the current standards for running a successful ATAC_Seq</strong> pipeline is listed below.</p>

    <h3>chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) :</h3>
    <p>In gene regulation studies, ChIP-Seq and ATAC-Seq have some similarities in thier pipeline approaches but their goals are different and using them rely much more on 
        your research interest. ChIP-seq is a center method used for characterizing genome-wide DNA-binding profile for a protein of interest. It provides a highly specific, 
        protein-centric view of the regulatory landscape, pinpointing where a particular factor—such as a histone modification or transcription factor—interacts with the genome.
        The quality of the data generated and also the analytical results is inherently dependent on the availability and quality of specific antibodies for the target protein.</p>

    <div class="centered-image">
        <img src="images_bioinfo/chip-seq.png" alt="Database Method" class="elegant-image"></div>

    <p class="spacing-md"></p>

    <p>As always, the first step is the library preparation stage begins by preparing samples which are then chemically fixed to preserve their 
        protein-DNA interactions. Next, the fixed chromatin is physically broken into smaller pieces (sheared). The target protein, along with 
        the DNA bound to it, is then selectively captured using a specific antibody attached to magnetic beads (immunoprecipitation). The isolated 
        complexes are washed, eluted, and the DNA is purified. This DNA is then prepared for sequencing through steps such as amplification 
        and adapter ligation, and is ultimately sequenced.</p>
    
    <p class="spacing-md"></p>

    <p>Once sequenced, the raw data undergoes a multi-step computational analysis. First, the sequenced fragments are mapped back to the genome. 
        The data is then normalized for comparison, and the patterns of where the protein binds are visualized across the genome. Key binding 
        regions, or "peaks," are identified. These peaks are analyzed to discover common DNA sequence patterns (motifs) and are annotated to 
        understand the associated chromatin states, such as promoters or enhancers. Finally, groups of genes near these binding sites are 
        analyzed to determine their biological roles, often revealing involvement in fundamental processes like cell proliferation, growth 
        regulation, and cell adhesion</p>

    <p class="spacing-md"></p>
    <p>ChIP-Seq has become a prominent method to analyse genomic interaction of DNA-protein interactions. Researchers can pinpoint precise 
        genomic binding sites, decipher the DNA codes recognized by proteins, and ultimately link these molecular events to critical biological 
        functions and regulatory networks within the cell. There are interesting ChIP-Seq data databases that can be explored and integrated 
        to provide more meaning to your research.</p>
